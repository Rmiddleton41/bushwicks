                   <h3><strong>Bushwick Bred</strong></h3> 
                   <p>What better way to start a site page on the Bushwick Collective than to REPRESENT some of the most famous from the area. With this line-up I think it near impossible to have a similar cast of talent repeated.</p>

                   <p>Can you really have Brooklyn Street Art without the Big man? I'm always amazed at how well these murals are done. The really interesting part of this work for me is the sweater they chose. Was it a favorite of his (Biggy) or the artist? </p>

                   <p>This Bender work was one of the fist we saw when we stepped out of the subway. I thought to myself "if this is how this walk is going to start we are in for a real treat".</p>

                    <p>Lookout BABE! While I'm more of a Marvel guy, ya gotta respect the Bat and the time this artist must have put into this work. Is it me or does the Joker alway seem to out play/act whoever the Batman is,in all the movies they star in together.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Black is Beautiful</strong></h3>
                    <p>This is a very large and long work of art. The message is one that I think to be rather beautiful. Unfortunately there are others who feel different. When I returned to this site a few months later, this work of art had been vandilized. Glad I was able to get this shot first.</p>

                    <p>This black and white which looks a lot like a work by Banksy was begging for us to participate, so I asked my wife to go back to back with the art. I don't know about you, but I think it worked out pretty well. I'm sure there are a lot of these out there.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Man with an Ascot</strong></h3>
                    <p>This larger than life work of art really jumped out at me. The uses of colors and the expresion on Mr. Ascots face definitely stayed with my wife and I for a few blocks. The way the canvas (bricks) were incorporated, I thought to be rather clever</p>

                    <p>I wanted to end this page with our little friend walking off into the great unknown. If you're wondering why I call this Simon, it's because our little friend reminds me of a little cartoon from my youth...I may have just given away my age.  </p>
